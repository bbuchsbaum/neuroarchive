This vignette demonstrates how to pick an appropriate number of
quantisation bits and how to inspect the diagnostics produced by the
`quant` transform.

```r
library(neuroarchive)
```

## Writing data with quantisation

```r
set.seed(1)
x <- array(rnorm(200), dim = c(10, 10, 2))
file <- tempfile(fileext = ".h5")
write_lna(x, file, transforms = "quant",
          transform_params = list(quant = list(bits = 6,
                                               allow_clip = TRUE)))
```

## Reading the quantisation report

```r
rep <- lna_get_quant_report(file, 0)
print(rep)
```

A simple histogram of the quantised values can be created from the
`histogram_quantized_values` entry of the report:

```r
hist(rep$histogram_quantized_values$breaks[-1],
     rep$histogram_quantized_values$counts,
     main = "Quantised value distribution",
     xlab = "Quant level", ylab = "Count",
     type = "h")
```

The report also contains the estimated signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in dB
which can help decide whether more bits are required.

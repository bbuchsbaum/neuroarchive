This vignette gives a brief tour of the HRBF (Hierarchical Radial Basis
Function) transforms introduced in LNA version 2.0.

```r
library(neuroarchive)
```

## Analytic HRBF

The `spat.hrbf` transform analytically generates a multiresolution RBF
basis. Only a small descriptor is stored in the file and the basis is
recreated on the fly by the reader. Coefficients can be computed
without keeping the dense basis matrix:

```r
write_lna(x, "analytic.h5", transforms = "spat.hrbf")
```
Extra dyadic levels can be added with the `num_extra_fine_levels` parameter.

Set `compute_atom_importance = TRUE` when writing to record per-atom
importance metrics which can later be used to keep only the top
contributing atoms during reconstruction.

From version 0.1.0 the parameters also include
`num_extra_fine_levels` which adds extra dyadic levels beyond
`levels`.  Each additional level halves `sigma` again and samples a
denser set of centres for capturing fine details.

## Project then Embed

`spat.hrbf_project` provides a lightweight way to project data onto an
analytic HRBF dictionary without storing the dictionary itself. This is
useful when paired with other transforms. For example, the following
pipeline performs PCA on HRBF coefficients:

```r
write_lna(x, "pca_hrbf.h5", transforms =
  c("spat.hrbf_project", "basis.pca", "embed.pca_on_hrbf_coeffs"))
```

## Compressing and Transferring Empirical Bases

Empirical bases learned from data can be compressed with
`basis.empirical_hrbf_compressed`. The resulting compact representation
can later be applied to new data with `embed.transfer_hrbf_basis`.

```r
# Compress a dense basis matrix B
write_lna(list(B = B), "dict.h5",
  transforms = "basis.empirical_hrbf_compressed")

# Apply that basis to new data
write_lna(x, "transfer.h5",
  transforms = "embed.transfer_hrbf_basis",
  transform_params = list(
    `embed.transfer_hrbf_basis` = list(
      source_lna_file_path = "dict.h5",
      source_transform_descriptor_name = "00_basis.empirical_hrbf_compressed.json"
    )
  )
)
```

These tools allow sophisticated spatial representations while keeping
files small and read/write operations fast.

Core computations such as Poisson-disk sampling and sparse coding are
implemented in C++ via Rcpp for performance. This acceleration is
enabled by default but can be disabled with
`options(lna.hrbf.use_rcpp_helpers = FALSE)` if a pure R fallback is
needed.

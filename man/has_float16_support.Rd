has_float16_support()
}
\value{
Logical scalar indicating availability of float16 support.
}
\description{
Determine whether the current R session can handle
half-precision (float16) numeric types. This helper looks for
optional packages known to provide such support. If none are found,
the function returns `FALSE`. For Phase 1 this is effectively a
stub and will typically return `FALSE`.

\usage{
materialise_plan(
  h5,
  plan,
  checksum = c("none", "sha256"),
  header = NULL,
  plugins = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{h5}{An open `H5File` object.}

\item{plan}{A `Plan` R6 object produced by `core_write`.}

\item{checksum}{Character string indicating checksum mode.}

\item{header}{Optional named list of header attributes.}

\item{plugins}{Optional named list of plugin metadata.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns the `H5File` handle. When `checksum = "sha256"`
  the file is first written with a placeholder checksum attribute, the
  SHA256 digest is computed on that file, and then the attribute is updated
  with the final value.  The handle is closed during digest calculation and
  is therefore invalid when the function returns.
}
\description{
Writes transform descriptors and payload datasets to an open
  HDF5 file according to the provided `plan`. Implements basic retry logic
  for common HDF5 errors.

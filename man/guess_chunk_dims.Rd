\title{Guess reasonable HDF5 chunk dimensions}
\usage{
guess_chunk_dims(dims, dtype_size)
}
\arguments{
\item{dims}{Integer vector of dataset dimensions.}

\item{dtype_size}{Size in bytes of a single data element.}
}
\value{
Integer vector of chunk dimensions.
}
\description{
Heuristic used when `chunk_dims` is `NULL` in
  `h5_write_dataset`. Chunks are targeted to ~1 MiB. For datasets
  larger than 4 GiB, the first dimension is halved until the estimated
  chunk size falls below 1 GiB. If the chunk would still exceed about
  256 MiB, an additional reduction is applied with a warning.

\usage{
\method{invert_step}{myorg.sparsepca}(type, desc, handle)
}
\description{
Reconstructs data from the sparse PCA coefficients and basis matrix.
If singular values were written during the forward step they are
applied before multiplying by the basis. The basis may be transposed
when `storage_order = "voxel_x_component"`.
}
\details{
The orientation of the stored basis matrix is controlled by the
\code{storage_order} parameter. The default is
\code{"component_x_voxel"}, but \code{"voxel_x_component"} is also
allowed.

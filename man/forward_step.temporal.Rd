\title{Temporal Transform - Core Infrastructure}
\usage{
\method{forward_step}{temporal}(type, desc, handle)
}
\description{
This file contains the core temporal transform infrastructure including
forward_step and invert_step functions. Individual basis types, projection,
and reconstruction methods are now organized in separate files:
}
\details{
- temporal_basis.R: Basis generation for DCT, B-spline, DPSS, polynomial, wavelet
- temporal_modwt.R: All MODWT-specific functions and methods  
- temporal_project.R: Projection methods with thresholding
- temporal_reconstruct.R: Reconstruction methods
- temporal_utils.R: Utility functions like suggest_dpss_fmri()
Temporal Transform - Forward Step

Projects data onto a temporal basis (DCT, B-spline, DPSS, polynomial, or wavelet).
Debug messages are controlled by the `lna.debug.temporal` option.

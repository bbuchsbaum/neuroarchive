\usage{
embed(data_or_pipe, basis_path = NULL, basis_step = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{data_or_pipe}{Data object or `lna_pipeline`.}

\item{basis_path}{Optional explicit HDF5 path to the basis matrix.}

\item{basis_step}{Optional step index or type to use for basis inference
instead of the immediately preceding step.}

\item{...}{Additional parameters for the embed transform.}
}
\value{
An `lna_pipeline` object with the embed step appended.
}
\description{
Adds an embedding step that projects the input data onto a basis
computed by a preceding transform. When called immediately after a
`basis` step (e.g., created by `pca()`), the path to the basis matrix
is inferred automatically using the conventional HDF5 location
`/basis/<NN>_basis/matrix` where `<NN>` is the zero-based index of the
previous step.

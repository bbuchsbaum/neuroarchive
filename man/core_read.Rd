\usage{
core_read(
  file,
  run_id = NULL,
  allow_plugins = c("installed", "none", "prompt"),
  validate = FALSE,
  output_dtype = c("float32", "float64", "float16"),
  roi_mask = NULL,
  time_idx = NULL,
  lazy = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{file}{Path to an LNA file on disk.}

\item{run_id}{Character vector of run identifiers or glob patterns. If
`NULL`, the first available run is used. Glob patterns are matched
against available run groups under `/scans`.}

\item{allow_plugins}{Character. How to handle transforms requiring
external packages. One of "installed" (default), "none", or "prompt".
"installed" attempts to use a transform if its implementation is
available, issuing a warning when missing. "prompt" in interactive
sessions asks whether to continue when a transform implementation is
missing (non-affirmative answers abort). Non-interactive sessions treat
"prompt" the same as "installed". "none" errors immediately when an
implementation is missing.}

\item{validate}{Logical flag indicating if validation should be
performed via `validate_lna()` before reading.}

\item{output_dtype}{Desired output data type. One of
`"float32"`, `"float64"`, or `"float16"`.}

\item{lazy}{Logical. If `TRUE`, the HDF5 file handle remains open
after return (for lazy reading).}
}
\value{
If a single run is selected, a `DataHandle` object. When
  multiple runs match and `lazy = FALSE`, a named list of `DataHandle`
  objects is returned.
}
\description{
Opens an LNA HDF5 file, discovers available transform
  descriptors and runs the inverse transform chain. This is a
  minimal skeleton used during early development.
